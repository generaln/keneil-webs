 <h2> Twelve Pillars by	Jim	Rohn and Chris Widener</h2>
 
<ol>
    <li><h4> Chapter 4 </h4></li>  
    <ul>
    <li>
    speaks to how to attain your goals  has Charlie had advice Michael -<br><b> “The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.”</b>  <br> Therefore Charlie sees it important to make a list of your goals instead of keeping them in your head can help to make those goals a reality.  
    </li>
    </ul> 
    <li><h4> Chapter 5 </h4></li>  
    <ul>
    <li>
    Best thing I learnt from chapter 5 is that a specific opportunity only comes once in a life time <br> as the quote mentions <b> “Every day has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.” </b>
    </li>
    </ul> 
    <li><h4>Chapter 6</h4></li>
    <ul>
    <li>
     This chapter teaches that your associates can impact your life so be wise in choosing <br>
    the right persons to associate yourself  <b> “Don’t join the crowd; you won’t grow. Go where the expectations and the demands are high.”</b>
    </li>
    </ul> 
    <li><h4>Chapter 7</h4></li>
    <ul>
    <li>
     This chapter teaches that you must not just rely on education but also use your common sense<br> and try to learn new things every day. <b> “Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune.” </b> 
    </li>
    </ul> 
    </ol>
